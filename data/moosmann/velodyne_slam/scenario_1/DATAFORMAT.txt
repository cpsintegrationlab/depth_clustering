General
=======
Throughout the dataset we use a right-handed coodinate system.
For each Velodyne-frame there is one line in the IMU recodings file.


Velodyne-Recordings
===================
Each 360° revolution of the Velodyne scanner was stored as 16bit png distance image (scan*.png).
The scanner turned clockwise, filling the image from the leftmost to the rightmost column, with
the leftmost and rightmost column being at the back of the vehicle. Note that measurements were
not corrected for vehicle movement. Thus and due to the physical setup of the laser diods, some
strange effects can be seen at the cut of the image when the vehicle is turning. As consequence,
it is best to ignore the 10 leftmost and rightmost columns of the image.
To convert the pixel values [0..65535] into meters, just divide by 500.
This results in an effective range of [0..131m].
Invalid measurements are indicated by zero distance.

To convert the distance values into 3D coordinates, use the setup in "img.cfg".
The yaw angles (counter-clockwise) are a linear mapping from the image column [0..869]->[180°..-180°]
The pitch angles are specified for each image row separately.

Data loss
=========
Unfortunately, some frames are completely missing and some frames have only partial data. Any algorithm must account for these problems.
Missing frames can easily be detected by using the timestamps of the IMU recordings.
Missing data within a frame can be detected by looking for invalid distance reedings.


IMU-Recordings
==============
These are given in the file "imu.cfg" and denote the position of the center of the cars' rear axis.
The most important values are:
latitude[grad]/longitude[grad]/altitude[m]: global positioning
heading[rad]: from east, couter-clockwise (towards north)
omega_heading[rad/s]: clockwise!!!
x[m]: to the front
y[m]: to the left
z[m]: up


Extrinsic Calibration
=====================
The Velodyne scanner was approximately calibrated wrt. the IMU coordinate system (center of rear axis).
offset_x:     0.79 m to the front
offset_y:     0 m
offset_z:     1.73 m upward
